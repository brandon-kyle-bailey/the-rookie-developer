## Goal

Finding a good starting point to contribute to open source is hard!

The intention behind this project is to create an open source community driven platform that allows people to share and develop their skill and knowledge using a real world project.

## Day One.

Day one of this project consisted of creating the initial repository structure, configuration of the `flask` backend server as well as producing the `landing`(home), `about` and `contact` pages.

In terms of design choices and `UX/UI`, `materialize` css and js were chosen for their minimalistic and clean presentation.
